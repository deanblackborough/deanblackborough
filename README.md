### Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dean Blackborough (that shouldn't be a suprise as it is my username).

I've been a web developer forever, mostly PHP, however I dabble with lots of other languages, most recently I've starting using C++ in anger and love it!

Since 2019 I've been concentrating on [Costs to Expect](https://api.costs-to-expect.com), a business I'd like to get off the ground.

Costs to Expect is a service we are building which includes an Open Source REST API, an expense app, budgeting apps a long-term social experiment tracking the cost to raise our children, a Yahtzee/Yatzy game scorer and other things, have a look if any of that sounds interesting.

- ðŸ”­ I'm working on anything and everything for [Costs to Expect](https://api.costs-to-expect.com), currently [Budget](https://budget.costs-to-expect.com) and [Budget Pro](https://budget-pro.costs-to-expect.com).
- ðŸŒ± For fun, I'm building a C++ [2D Game Engine](https://github.com/deanblackborough/Prune2D) to build games with my kids and learn C++.
- ðŸŒ± For fun, I'm building a C++ [Maths Quiz](https://github.com/deanblackborough/MathsQuiz) console app for my nine and three year old to learn C++.
- ðŸŒ± For fun, I'm building a [Yahtzee](https://github.com/costs-to-expect/yahtzee) game scorer, powered by the [Costs to Expect API](https://api.costs-to-expect.com).
- ðŸŒ± For fun, I'm building a [Yatzy](https://github.com/costs-to-expect/yatzy) game scorer, powered by the [Costs to Expect API](https://api.costs-to-expect.com).
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: My email is on my profile
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with new game scorers, check out [Yahtzee](https://github.com/costs-to-expect/yahtzee) and [Yatzy](https://github.com/costs-to-expect/yatzy) as a base, docs coming soon(tm)
