### Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dean Blackborough (that shouldn't be a suprise as it is my username).

I've been a web developer for more than twenty years, mostly PHP, however I dabble with lots of other languages.

Since 2019 I've been concentrating on [@coststoexpect](https://api.costs-to-expect.com). 

Costs to Expect is a service we are building which includes an Open Source REST API, a commercial app and a long-term social experiment, have a look if that sounds interesting.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [@coststoexpect](https://api.costs-to-expect.com)
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m hoping to be working on [PHP Quill renderer](https://github.com/deanblackborough/php-quill-renderer) soon
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: My email is on my profile
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with the [@coststoexpect](https://api.costs-to-expect.com) API
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with [PHP Quill renderer](https://github.com/deanblackborough/php-quill-renderer), plans for v4, not much time
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning dev ops, forever it seems
