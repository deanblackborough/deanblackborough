### Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dean Blackborough (that shouldn't be a suprise as it is my username).

I've been a web developer forever, mostly PHP, however I dabble with lots of other languages, most recently I've starting using C++ and love it!

Since 2019 I've been concentrating on [Costs to Expect](https://api.costs-to-expect.com), a business my Wife and I started.

Costs to Expect is a service we are building which includes an Open Source REST API, an expense app, budgeting apps a long-term social experiment tracking the cost to raise our children, a Yahtzee/Yatzy game scorer and other things, have a look if any of that sounds interesting.

- ðŸ”­ I'm working on anything and everything for [Costs to Expect](https://api.costs-to-expect.com), currently [Budget](https://budget.costs-to-expect.com) and [Budget Pro](https://budget-pro.costs-to-expect.com).
