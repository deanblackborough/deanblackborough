### Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dean Blackborough (that shouldn't be a suprise as it is my username).

I've been a web developer for more than twenty years, mostly PHP, however I dabble with lots of other languages.

Since 2019 I've been concentrating on the [@coststoexpect API](https://api.costs-to-expect.com) and [@coststoexpect App](https://app.costs-to-expect.com)

Costs to Expect is a service we are building which includes an Open Source REST API, a commercial app and a long-term social experiment tracking the cost to raise our children, have a look if that sounds interesting.
