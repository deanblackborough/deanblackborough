### Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dean Blackborough (that shouldn't be a suprise as it is my username).

I've been a web developer for more than twenty years, mostly PHP, however I dabble with lots of other languages, most recently I've been trying to use C++ in anger.

Since 2019 I've been concentrating on the [@coststoexpect API](https://api.costs-to-expect.com) and [@coststoexpect App](https://app.costs-to-expect.com)

Costs to Expect is a service we are building which includes an Open Source REST API, an expenses app, a budgeting app a long-term social experiment tracking the cost to raise our children and commercial apps, have a look if any of that sounds interesting.

- ðŸ”­ I'm working on a freelance project.
- ðŸ”­ I'm working on the [@coststoexpect API](https://api.costs-to-expect.com) and the rest of the [@coststoexpect](https://github.com/costs-to-expect).
- ðŸŒ± For fun, I'm building a C++ [2D Game Engine](https://github.com/deanblackborough/Prune2D) to build games with my kids and learn C++.
- ðŸŒ± For fun, I'm building a C++ [Maths Quiz](https://github.com/deanblackborough/MathsQuiz) app for my nine and three year old and using it to learn C++.
- ðŸŒ± For fun, I'm building a [Yahtzee](https://github.com/costs-to-expect/yahtzee) game scorer, powered by the [@coststoexpect API](https://api.costs-to-expect.com).
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m planing to work on [PHP Quill renderer](https://github.com/deanblackborough/php-quill-renderer) later this year
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: My email is on my profile
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with [PHP Quill renderer](https://github.com/deanblackborough/php-quill-renderer), plans for v4, not much time
