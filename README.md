### Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dean Blackborough

I've been a web developer forever (mid 90s), mostly PHP, however I dabble with lots of other languages, recent favourites are C++ and GDScript, I'm a major fan of C++.

Since 2019 I've been concentrating on [Costs to Expect](https://api.costs-to-expect.com), a business my Wife and I started, there are several projects.

Costs to Expect is a service which includes an Open Source REST API, an expense app, two budgeting apps a long-term social experiment tracking the cost to raise our children, a Yahtzee/Yatzy game scorer and other things, have a look if any of that sounds interesting.
